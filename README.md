Part 1: 

● Similarity between Java and Python is that they both are object-oriented programming languages (OOP). Both languages are using similar syntax for defining classes and creating objects. 

● Difference is that Java is statically typed while Python is dynamically typed. It means that in Java, you must explicitly declare variable types while on the other hand, Python is allowing variable types to be determined at runtime.

● In Java, an object is a specific example of a class. It acts like a blueprint for creating it. Objects help organize code by grouping related data and functions together. It makes it easier to understand and manage the code. 
Objects have properties (ex. color, age, height) and can perform actions through methods.

● A constructor in Java is a special method that is called when an object is created from a class. It initializes the object's attributes (properties) and sets up its initial state. 
Constructors can take parameters to provide values for properties allowing us to customize each object as it is created. 

● Attributes in Java hold data that defines the state of an object (ex. name, age, color, height). They can be of different types (integers, strings, double, char…). Usually, they are defined at the beginning of the class.

● Version control is a system that helps track changes in files over time. It allows us to see what changes were made, who made a change and when. It makes collaboration easier because it enables multiple people to work on the same project without overwriting each other's work. 
Also, if something goes wrong, version control allows us to revert to earlier versions of files which helps us keep the project safe.

● The development process also known as Test-Driven Development (TDD) involves writing tests for a part of code before actually writing the code itself. 
We write the test first. It defines what the code should do, and then we write the minimum amount of code needed to pass the test. 
Then we refactor the code to improve it while making sure all tests still pass, promoting reliable, high quality software.
